### Explanation of Pixel Grid
Since so many of our SVGs appear so small, designing them on the pixel grid will help them not appear fuzzy when they’re sized down to 16x16 pixels.

For Illustrator you’ll want the following settings:

- **Document settings**: Units: pixels, Advanced > check ‘Align New Objects to Pixel Grid’

You can download a sample Illustrator file [here](pixel-grid-illustrator.ai).

You can download a sample Sketch file [here](pixel-grid-sketch.sketch).

### Tips for Illustrator SVGs
When you’re designing your icons in a graphics editor like Adobe Illustrator, there are a lot of things you can do that will bring down the size of the file and make your SVGs easier for the developers to work with. Here are some of them:

- Expand paths
- Simplify paths (Object > Path > Simplify)
- Expand objects so that stokes become objects (keep aspect ratio intact)

### Contributing Other Design Workflows
If you’re using a design tool that isn’t listed here and you’d like to add the instructions for how to expand paths, simplify paths, expand strokes, etc., please [open a PR]()! We’d super appreciate it + you’d be the best :100:

If you’ve found an issue with any of the design flows, please let us know by [opening an issue]() and tagging it with a ```design``` label.
